/* Goal:
  get average of top 5 scores of each student & arrange in order of each id

  eg: 
    Input: [[1,91],[1,92],[2,93],[2,97],[1,60],[2,77],[1,65],[1,87],[1,100],[2,100],[2,76]]
    Output: [[1,87],[2,88]]
      Explanation: 
        The average of the student with id = 1 is 87.
        The average of the student with id = 2 is 88.6. But with integer division their average converts to 88.
