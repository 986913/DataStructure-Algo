/*
an array-like data structure whose elements follow the FIFO rule: First In, First Out
- the following are a queue's standard operations and their time complexities:
    - Enqueuing an element into the queue —> O(1)
    - Dequeuing an element out of the queue ——> O(1)
    - peeking at the element on the front of the queue —→O(1)
    - searching for an element in the queue ——→ O(n)
A stack is typically implemented with a doubly linked list
