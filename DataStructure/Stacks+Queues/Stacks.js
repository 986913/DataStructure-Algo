/* an array-like data structure whose elements follow the LIFO rule: Last In, First Out
  the following are a stack's standard operations and their time complexities:
    - pushing an element onto the stack —> O(1)
    - popping an element off the stack ——> O(1)
    - peeking at the element on the top of the stack —→O(1)
    - searching for an element in the stack ——→ O(n)
- A stack is typically implemented with a dynamic array  or with a singly linked list
